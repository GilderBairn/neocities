# Neocities site

## Intro
Hello, this is where I'm storing my working changes to my neocities site. A couple goals I have for this are:
- use vanilla javascript, html, css etc. as much as possible
- if I do use a dependency, use unpkg, or another way to link from the static html (no npm!)
- the purpose of this site is to experiment and code for fun, not necessarily to be a professional example or portfolio piece

## ethos
I am not necessarily hoping to perfectly mimick the classic geocities approach to websites. There are some points of old-style web that I love, and think the modern internet could benefit from. However, I'm not necessarily trying to capture a certain aesthetic or make this an exercise in learning old methodologies. Some points of the old-school / vanilla approach that I like:
- The web is for everyone, and having the components of a site available and accessible is a good thing. i.e. regular, un-obfuscated source files that can be downloaded on their own or viewed through browser tooling helps demystify how the web works
- Modern SPA-style sites and the javascript framework world have been the only point of exposure for making dynamic sites for a lot of developers. These tools have their uses, but it is worthwhile to be familiar with both:
  - the power and effectiveness you can achieve without the bloat and complexity of these tools (especially for small projects)
  - the lower-level details of what these tools provide for you when you need them
- The web can (and should) be a format for the people, and not relegated to only transactional 'business' uses. It can be for fun too, and for sharing creativity and joy with other people around the world.
- There is a benefit (even if its hard to articulate) to seeing what you can make by hand with very simple tools
