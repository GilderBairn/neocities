    <h4>What are these?</h4>
    <p>
        Sometimes when I'm playing games, especially some RPGs, I like to form a note-taking / journaling exercise around the game. I'll take notes on what happens to my character(s) while playing and then sometime later use those notes to reconstruct a journal from the perspective of inside the game. Here you can find some of those journals that I've collected and turned into web pages. Feel free to read along.
